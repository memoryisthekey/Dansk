## Possessive Pronouns

> Note1: In Danish there are "et" words and "en" words. This is relevant for this section because if the possessive pronoun will change according to this. 

| English  | Danish (en / et / plural)  |  Pronunciation  | Sound |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|:-----:|
|   mine   |      min / mit / mine      | mín, mít, mínne |       |
|   yours  |      din / dit / dine      | dín, dít, dínne |       |

|   hers   |           hendes           |                 |       |
|    -     |          dens/dets         |                 |       |
|   ours   |            vores           |                 |       |
|   yours  |            jeres           |                 |       |
|  theirs  |            deres           |                 |       |

> In Danish there **is a differentiation** between talking about something that **belongs to the subject** or something that belongs to another person in the phrase.
> 
> As an example saying: `Hun elsker hendes mand` literally means `She loves another woman's husband`
> 
> So to say that `She loves her own husband` would be `Hun elsker sin mand`. 
> 
> And so we have the following table for talking about one's own stuff:

|     English     | Danish (en / et / plural) | Pronunciation |  Sound |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| his / hers own  |      sin / sit / sine     |               |        |
